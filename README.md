To create a video streaming backend like YouTube that has the option to select multiple qualities in Node.js,
you will need to use a combination of technologies. Here are the basic steps you would need to take:

// Ist path
> Use a Node.js web framework such as Express to handle the server-side logic of your application.
> Use a video transcoding library like ffmpeg to convert your videos into different qualities and formats.
> Use a package like multer to handle file uploads to your server.
> Use a package like hls-server to stream videos to clients using the HLS protocol.
> Use a package like dash-js to stream videos to clients using the DASH protocol
> Use a database like MongoDB to store information about the videos, such as their title, description, and file path.
> Use a front-end framework like React or Angular to create the user interface for your application.
> Use web-socket to stream the video on realtime


// IInd path
> Use a Node.js web framework such as Express to handle the server-side logic of your application.
> Use a cloud-based video transcoding service like AWS Elastic Transcoder to convert your videos into different qualities and formats.
> Use a cloud-based storage service like AWS S3 to store your videos.
> Use a package like stream to handle video streaming in node.js
> Use a package like hls-server to stream videos to clients using the HLS protocol.
> Use a package like dash-js to stream videos to clients using the DASH protocol
> Use a database like MongoDB to store information about the videos, such as their title, description, and file path.
> Use a front-end framework like React or Angular to create the user interface for your application.
> Use web-socket to stream the video on realtime


// IIIrd path
> Use a cloud-based video transcoding service like Zencoder or Mux to convert your videos into different qualities and formats.
> Use a cloud-based storage service like Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3 to store your videos.
> Use a package like nginx-rtmp-module to handle video streaming on the server side.
> Use a package like hls.js to stream videos to clients using the HLS protocol.
> Use a package like shaka-player to stream videos to clients using the DASH protocol
> Use a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store information about the videos, such as their title, description, and file path.
> Use a front-end framework like React or Angular to create the user interface for your application.
> Use web-socket to stream the video on realtime
